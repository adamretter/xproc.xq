# xproc.xq

xproc.xq is an XProc processor built using XQuery 3.0, on top of MarkLogic.

# For the Impatient (quick setup)

MarkLogic v6.03 or higher is required.

Make src/xquery modules accessible (for example, by creating an appserver, which points to the xproc.xq distribution).

# FAQ

xproc.xq has limited compliance across broad areas. If interested in a specific feature, best to contact me direct for now.
